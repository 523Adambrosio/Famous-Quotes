        Reflection on Quotes
      </h1>

        <h4>
        These famous quotes are very special to me because they talk about life and life's struggles. These quotes are so special to me because all these quotes are from some of the best sports players, best actors, and smartest people. It shows that they are normal people at heart to. Most of these quotes are inspirational and motivated quotes. These people went through very tough obstacles throughout their life. And they want to share with the people to not worry about all these other things. They don't want normal society to worry about all these things and to just live life. These quotes are very important to me because some talk about your choice of words. Your words can be impactful from one person to a whole group of people. And it seems that the less you speak the more sucessful you will be. Not speaking could mean that your learning more and not talking nonsense. It is important as a society and people that we listen to more signficant quotes like this more often. We need quotes and sayings like these to keep us inspired and motivated to do more.
